Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End developer. I am looking for a job as a Junior Front-End developer in a friendly team to implement projects that change the World. I am proficient in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I am a fast learner, responsible, and ready for challenging tasks.

First of all, I want to say that computer science began to interest me when I got my first personal computer in the 2000s. At that time I still wanted to start developing in this direction, but I did not have the Internet to search for information, and there was no financial opportunity to look for a mentor who would help me learn.

After this time a lot of things in my life changed, there were ups and downs. And now the time has come when I remembered my childhood dream and said to myself, I want to become a programmer...
